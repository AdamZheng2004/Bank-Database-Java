# Bank-Database-Java

Utilizing the SQL bank database created for CSC 370 as a templete to implement a similar idea in Java.

Goal is to utilize what I've learned from the Java SE 17 Developer study guide
- Objects for each of the entity tables (fields are attributes)
- Basic getter and setter methods
- More complex actions like transfer money, and withdraws
- Proper usage of access modifiers for some form of security
- Utilize basic API's like Date
- Create and use interfaces
- Lambda expressions
